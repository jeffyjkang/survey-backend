# Take-home exercise for backend interviews at Eaze

Build the API to allow for the anonymous creation/taking of surveys (i.e. you don't have to create a user account to create a survey).

Ideally you will use either NodeJS, or .NET Core. These are the two primary platforms that we use at Eaze. You may use another language/platform (e.g., Python, Java, Ruby) if you so choose, but please be aware it will take us significantly longer in that case to get back to you with feedback.

## General

* Please include a README with instructions on how to run it. 
* Use whatever libraries you like. 
* Finally, have fun!

## Specifications:

API Should Support:
* Creating a survey
* Taking a Survey
* Getting Results of a Survey
* A survey should consist of survey questions and each question should have yes/no (true/false) answers

Note: no frontend is needed and any submitted will not be part of review.

## Data Persistence

* You will need to persist the data in some way. 
* You DO NOT need to use any external data persistance (database,cache etc), and the easier for us to run it the better :).  
* But think about how you would want to do it in production and write up (one paragraph) how you would do it.
